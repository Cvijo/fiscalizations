# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We're only supporting the latest version of each library. We don't maintain our old versions. If you want the latest, most performant and safest code, use the latest version all the time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a security issue in the latest version of any library, open a github issue and we will respond, assess and we can discuss the possible timeframe of a fix. 
Even if you're capable of fixing it yourself, it's better to open a github issue first, so we can discuss the code changes. If you open a PR right away, it might happen that we will require you to change a lot of stuff in the code you just wrote. The code needs to be alligned with the other code in the repository.
